The Ymuno Festival arrived in the summer of 2010. Its aim was to bring together and unite communities across the country in a celebratory atmosphere filled with great music, food, and drinks. From its inception, the festival was founded on this principle, and this ethos was the driving force behind its success.

In its seminal year, ticket numbers were limited; there were likely only two or three degrees of separation between the 250 people in attendance. Those reduced numbers served to form connections and relationships as central themes to the festival's DNA. This close-knit community identity, both in it's management and clientele, would earn the event a reputation as the "little festival with the big heart."

The festival welcomed attendees from a variety of different locations. Local residents from Bangor, Caernarfon, Colwyn Bay, as well as groups from further afield, such as Manchester, Brighton, London, Sheffield, Carlisle, Leeds, Bristol, and Halifax attended. This diversity of attendees helped create a vibrant and inclusive festival atmosphere, bringing people from all walks of life together to celebrate the power of music and community.

Who played
----------

6ix Toys brought their high-energy live performances to the event, drawing from a variety of influences, including jazz, soul, and afrobeat. Their unique sound was both danceable and musically intricate, thanks to the seven-piece lineup that included horns, keys, and percussion.

The Mouse Outfit, a Manchester-based group, showcased their mix of hip-hop, jazz, and funk. With a full horn section, MCs, and vocalists, they whipped up a storm in the barns.

Chloe Leavers, a singer-songwriter from North Wales, performed her ethereal vocals and introspective lyrics at the festival.

Julia Harris  brought her mix of folk, pop, and rock with powerful vocals and emotionally resonant lyrics. Having performed at festivals like Glastonbury and the Cambridge Folk Festival, her performance was enjoyed by many.

Stuart McCallum & Band brought their atmospheric soundscapes to the tipis. Best known as the guitarist for The Cinematic Orchestra, Stuart is also a respected solo artist in his own right. His music combined jazz, ambient, and electronic influences.

Fredo is a DJ and producer affiliated with 6ix Toys and The No Fakin' DJs. His eclectic set blended together genres like funk, hip hop, reggae, and salsa.

Matt Deficit, a DJ and promoter from North Wales, showcased his diverse taste in music at the festival, playing everything from drum and bass to house. His set featured a mix of classic tracks and new discoveries.

The Safires, a Manchester-based band, blend together elements of folk, chillout, and electronica. Their music featured intricate fingerpicking, lush harmonies, and electronic beats, drawing comparisons to artists like Zero 7 and Bonobo. They have performed at festivals like Beat-Herder and Kendal Calling and had been featured on BBC Introducing.

The Nice Sharp Pencils, a Halifax-based duo, brought their stripped-down approach to rock music to the festival, eschewing guitars in favour of drums and bass. Their music was loud, raw, and catchy.

A raw and emotive performer, Kev Fox used loops, delay, and reverb in his acoustic act to create a powerful and soulful sound that was compared to the likes of Damien Rice, The Verve, and early U2. He performed with his backing band, which included drums and double bass, and his soaring vocals added a sense of beauty to his sensitive and soulful songs.

Becca's songs had always been sweet treats, but with the added dimension of the Broken Biscuits, particularly Anna's heartbreaking cello, they had become that little bit more special. This was grown-up, thoughtful, emotional music that cut to your heart and fed your soul, and it was simply beautiful.

The Twilight Elevators hailed from the high hills of West Yorkshire. Initially, a duo consisting of Marc Ransley on resonator guitar and Joss Worthington on vocals and bass, the band was completed by the arrival of Chris Smith on drums in September 2009. Their influences ranged from a wide variety of Alternative and Americana acts past and present, and their sound was a collage of rock, folk, country and blues served up with a post-modern English twist.

The Billy No Fear trio consisted of Philip Elbourne, Jo Marsh and Emily-Ruth. French students at the University of Chester, who since graduating, had moved in together and adopted a pet goat. They were surreal and wonderful.

Brand and identity
------------------

The festival's early visual style was designed by [Kev Adamson](https://kevadamson.com/north-wales-web-design/ymuno-festival-website), a North Wales based graphic designer. Kev provided the website design and brand assets which were used by the team. The logo design was inspired by the profile of the river Conwy at Tal-y-Cafn, which was the intended venue for the event. At late notice, Hendre Hall, near Bangor, stepped in and offered their premises and facilities.
