The Scrum framework is a familiar model in technology departments, promoting collaboration, iterative progress, and continuous improvement. Although it's not without isses, I firmly believe that its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. However, to get the most out of it, you need to put in some effort and continuously refine a teams practice.

To ensure that our team functions at its best and consistently delivers value, we conduct regular Scrum health checks. These health checks provide us with invaluable insights into our performance, helping us identify areas for improvement and fostering a culture of continuous learning. As the lead, I usually initiate and facilitate these checks, but it's something a Scrum Master could easily do too.

**How we do it**

We approach the health check as a team, collectively reviewing our performance across nine crucial topics:

1.  Sprint Planning
2.  Daily Scrum
3.  Sprint Review
4.  Sprint Retrospective
5.  Product Owner
6.  Scrum Master
7.  Dev Team Skills
8.  Product Backlog
9.  Sprint Backlog

The primary goal is to pinpoint our strengths and weaknesses, gauge the overall health of our team, and identify areas for improvement that we can act on.

We review ten set statements per topic, covering essential aspects of the Scrum framework. The team discuss the statement, based on their experiences - is it a true statement? We discuss each statement until we can reach an agreement. Sometimes the statements are intentionally ambiguous to prompt discussion. Higher scores indicate strong agreement with the statement, while lower scores highlight areas that need attention and improvement.

Using the [Scrum Health Checker](https://github.com/asherawelan/scrum-health-checker), we aggregate and visualize the scores with a radar chart. This graphical representation simplifies identifying patterns and trends across the different topics.

The chart displays each topic from the health check as a point on the graph. The farther a data point extends from the centre, the more statements the team agree with. The red line shows an expected The tool saves the answers in json format, that can be downloaded with a team name and date.

**Taking action and driving improvement**

The real value of the Scrum health check comes from the actions we take afterward. While the chart offers an insightful visual representation, exploring the narratives behind the trends is more valuable. We review the data and define actionable steps to address the areas for improvement we've identified. This might involve targeted training sessions, process adjustments, improved communication, or adopting successful practices from other areas.

**Conclusion**

Our team has benefited over and over again from these Scrum health checks. They provide us with a valuable opportunity to reflect, assess, and enhance our Scrum practices. It's not about being perfect from the start; it's about continuously learning, evolving, and embracing an agile mindset to become even better.
