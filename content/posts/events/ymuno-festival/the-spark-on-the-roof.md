In the late spring of 2009, Ross and I sat in a pub in Sowerby Bridge, listening to Kirk McElhinney and Jason Singh (later The Safires) entertains a packed crowd with their sensational music. A few drinks later and some crazy ideas were flowing about inviting these minstrels to North Wales and hosting a party at our gaff in Colwyn Bay.

We invited a bunch of like-minded friends from different communities around North Wales, Halifax and Manchester. Before long, our rooftop was awash with food, drink and dancing feet. Old acquaintances reunited, good friendships were enjoyed, new friends, and communities collided. It was a blast.

In the glowing aftermath of that night, many a conversation took place all around the same sort of questions - What made it so special? Could it be done again?

It boiled down to these things; it was all about community, linked friendships, and trusting the idea that when two people who like each other bring together other people they like, it works a treat. And new connections are made, laughs are plenty, food and drink are enjoyed and, well, sometimes new festivals are born.
