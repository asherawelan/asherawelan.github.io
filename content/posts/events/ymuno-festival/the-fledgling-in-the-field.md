The Ymuno Festival returned in 2011, building on the central themes of community and relationships. The festival's permanent home was found at Bryn Ffanigl Ganol Farm, not far from Abergele, on the North Wales coast.

Reviews from 2010 spoke of the quality of the acts and chilled vibe of the event, of its locally sourced hearty Community Breakfast, and its inviting fire pits. The challenge for 2011 was to build on those themes and build a community.
