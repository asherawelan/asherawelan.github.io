The Ymuno Festival took a fallow year in 2012 to consider direction and focus. The event returned in 2013 with fresh energy, a constitution, and an expanded team to deliver it.

That team collaborated with exceptional talent, impressive performers, local artists and local industries of distinction to broaden the event's appeal. Central pillars to this delivery were for it to be family-friendly, affordable, and begin the challenge of being greener. Programming and marketing communicated that message to young families, and the festival grew.

When a bold funding application to the Arts Council for Wales was unsuccessful, the festival used Kick Starter to raise awareness and offset most financial risk. The Arts Council praised this approach and granted an award in response to a more modest second application. The festival also benefited from a grant from the Rural Development Fund to further develop its relationship with the local farming community.

Ymuno Festival also developed an alliance with Arts & Business Cymru. With the help of Arts & Business, the festival built a commercial and in-kind relationship with The Great Orme Brewery. This unique award-winning partnership would remain in place for the festival's lifetime.

Who played
----------

Amy's Ghost delivered a highly visual live performance that exceeded what they produced in the studio. Clad in ghostly gothic wedding garb, their alt-pop folk energy drew in the crowd, a set that has yet to be forgotten.

Banda Bacana was a terrific live band that played groove-based music drawing from various influences and cultures. Their performance, which included funk, afrobeat, Latin, reggae, and ska, had the audience getting down and having fun.

Bear Beats Band, hailing from the beautiful countryside of Denbighshire in North Wales, played an intoxicating mix of contemporary folk blended with world music elements, making for a stand-out performance.

Ben Parker, part of the Ebenezer Chapter, a group of local musicians on Anglesey, shared his developing talent as a young up-and-coming local singer-songwriter.

Blue Rose Code, a London-based / Edinburgh-born band, played beautiful, classic-sounding songs described as 'Caledonian Soul', and their performance was just as stunning.

Dion Jones, the young Welsh songsmith from Caernarfon, armed with his guitar, raw vocals, and a truckload of passion, delivered a memorable performance.

Gareth Bonello's acoustic performance drew on elements of traditional Welsh music and folklore to create modern folk music that left the audience comparing him to luminaries such as Nick Drake and John Martyn.

JP Cooper returned with a warm blend of gospel-flavored folk-soul. He was as ever, unpretentious, authentic and humble, making for a moving and intimate performance.

Julia Harris returned to play her spiky folk-funk, presenting songs from her recently released album 'Colour Bomb' with high energy, percussive acoustic finger-picking, passionate vocals, and an infectious charm that was hard to resist.

Kathryn Williams' performance, featuring softly-expressed passions, was as big as it gets. Her songs, shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize, were beautifully executed and left a lasting impression on the audience.

Kyle Lee & The Mexican Walking Fish graced the stage with something different. With Kyle's liquid gold voice and melancholic songwriting, and the band's spaghetti western trumpet, they delivered a fantastic performance.

After temporarily hanging up her bass with the Magic Numbers, Michele Stodart captivated the audience with her debut solo album of blues, country, and Americana. A terrific set, with a full band, and Romeo on bass, she was a headline like no other.

Neil McSweeney's performance was intensely beautiful, featuring deeply felt, brooding songs with rich imagery and magical hooks from his acoustic guitar. Later in the evening, he again performed for those fortunate to be sat around the fire.

Nick Pride & The Pimptones' funky soul stew of phat grooves and beefy breaks, with all the harmonic sophistication that jazz cats love, kept the dance floor moving throughout the night.

PJ Fothergill's acoustic slot was filled with favourites such as Standing Alone and Nostalgia, a well-received and touching set.

Riot Jazz twisted funk, soul, hip-hop, and aggressive jazz into their LIVE Mancsterdam-based, 9-piece lovin' aggro-jazz brass ensemble, creating another unique and unforgettable headline.

TACSI, an 8-piece bilingual band from Anglesey in North Wales, heavily influenced by reggae, funk, soul, and blues while retaining a uniquely Celtic flavour delivered an energetic and exciting performance.

The Lucky Strikes, a blues, garage, Americana, Spaghetti Western, fiddle-powered, howlin', heavin', rock 'n' roll band from the Thames River Delta, provided an electrifying performance.

Tom Copson delivered a stunning performance with an incredible four-octave range, a sense of humour, and a guitar.

Husband and wife duo Tim and Ann O'Hare brought their infectious creativity and passion. Hailing from Llanelli, their music and songs expressed their journey and experiences. Their performance was inspiring and left a lasting impression on the audience.

Poets
-----

Y Gogledd sings of myth - of forests and gods, lakes and castles, mountains and dreamers. Metaforestry's poetry, song and art celebrate North Wales - the land that shapes our mouths, minds and creations as our hands shape her.

An electrifying poet, Martin Daws' live set blended free musicality and innovative lyricism in unique improvised theatre. Youth Poet Laureate for Wales and undoubtedly one of the UK's best performance poets - he entertained all.

Harry Baker made his audience laugh and cry with his clever wordplay. A poet who had won several slam poetry championships, including the 2010 London Slam Championship, 2011 UK Slam Championship, 2011 European Slam Championship, entertained all. He brought something entirely different to the sleepy meadow and left the crowd wanting more.

Activities & Attractions
------------------------

Cimera, a newly formed contemporary circus from Caernarfon, offered interactive circus, aerial and acrobatic performances, and fire shows. They could be spotted stilt walking in fairy costumes around the site, entertaining and delighting festival-goers.

Dr Zigs, an avant-garde group of unique bubblers, brought laughter and awe to the field. Dr Zigs has been bubbling since 2010 and has grown in fame and popularity. They had a magical ability to unleash the universal inner child that could still squeal with delight, laugh with pure joy and stare and gasp in amazement.

Rob Starbuck, the craftsman, conservationist, and creative expert, ran some unique cob oven-building and bread-making workshops. Those involved gathered mud from the stream, used fresh straw, and built an oven fit for impromptu pizza making!

The Coastal Hawks Project was an exciting opportunity to get up close and personal with some fantastic birds of prey. They brought their unique educational experience packed with historical elements, medieval gear, and costumes!

Engedi Arts hosted creative workshops with story writing, painting, character building, and tale-telling with younger visitors in mind. Festival-goers indulged their creative sides with the help of the Engedi team and left the festival with some new skills and stories to share.

Artists
-------

The theme for the event was "Heartland", drawing on identity, culture, community and celebration. The creative expressions were personal, geopolitical, historical and spiritual.

To support the theme, Hannah Stoney developed a beautiful piece of papercut art as a motif for the festival. For years, this artwork would find its way on tote bags, graffiti walls, and tee shirts.

Mr Kobo returned to the event with large canvases to interpret the event through spray paint. His distinctive style was engaging and connected, inclusive and diverse.
