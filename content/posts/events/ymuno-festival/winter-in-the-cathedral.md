On a chilly Saturday in December 2013, St Asaph Cathedral opened its doors to welcome the Ymuno Festival for a special winter event. The grand stone venue, dressed for Christmas, was washed with misted vibrant hues of purple, pink, and green as seasonal mulled wine and mince pies were served. Headlined by Welsh folk/pop duo, Paper Aeroplanes, and supported by the mesmerizing collaboration of Greg Russell & Ciaran Algar, this one-off event was a sell-out, promising an unforgettable night of music and magic.

The event's support team worked closely with the Diocese, continuing to build the in-kind relationship.
Working with a specialist UAV company, the partnership provided commercial footage of the Cathedral from height as a marketing asset.

Ymuno Festival commissioned Purple Cabbage Media to produce a video of the evening, capturing some of the vibe and talent, using some of the drone footage.
