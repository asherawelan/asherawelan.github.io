Michele Stodart
What an absolute pleasure to welcome Michele Stodart back to North Wales.
Michele Stodart is a solo artist as well as bassist, vocalist and co-songwriter with much loved, double-platinum selling The Magic Numbers. After almost a decade of touring world-wide with the band, in 2012, Michele self-released an album of her own songs, Wide-Eyed Crossing, a southern-drenched journey into Americana country blues. Michele later signed to none othe than Bjork's record label One Little Indian, releasing her second album Pieces in 2016.
These albums, as well as Michele’s intimate, heart-wrenching live performances helped her gain recognition for her solo material and proved she is an artist and songwriter in her own right.
In-between recording and touring, Michele has been building a name for herself as musical director, curator and collaborator for a range of events, from International Women’s Day, for festival stage takeovers. She promotes regular monthly nights at Camden’s legendary Green Note which she curates and hosts together with her brother, Romeo. Using her skills as a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist has also led to many collaborative projects on stage and in the studio, with artists such Billy Bragg, Kathryn Williams, David Ford, Ren Harvieu, Charlie Dore, David Kitt, O'Hooley & Tidow amongst many others.
Kirk McElhinney Trio
The quality of Kirk McElhinney’s songwriting, his voice and guitar playing is recognised by any who come across his work.
His sound once described by Nitin Sawney as "a melting pot of sonic bliss", Kirk himself calls urban folk.
His songs and his delivery have an uncanny ability to capture people’s hearts and move minds and bodies.
On the road promoting his new album "You Are Not Your Past" on Manchester WorldFolk label Limefield, he’s joined by 2 artists in their own right.
Andy Hay on drums recently released his second album after the acclaimed “Many Rivers” made its mark on the British music scene and long time collaborator John Ellis has worked with The Cinematic Orchestra, Corinne Bailey Rae, Lily Allen, Tom Jones and too many more to mention.
