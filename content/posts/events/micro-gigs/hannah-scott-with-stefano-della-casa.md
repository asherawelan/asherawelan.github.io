Hosted by the wonderful Vino Mondo, with just 20 tickets for sale, this evening with Hannah Scott promises to be something magical.

From Suffolk via Italy, Hannah Scott performs contemporary folk music and is picking up a loyal following thanks to her distinctive voice, strong melodies and thought-provoking lyrics.

She has found her musical home with creative partner Stefano Della Casa, and their new album, Pieces Of The Night is out now. Hannah’s music has been heard on BBC Radio 2, including a live session on Dermot O’Leary’s Saturday afternoon show, and praise for her work has arrived from publications such as MOJO and The Guardian.

Her arresting live performances have earned her support slots for the likes of 10cc and Seth Lakeman and shows at venues such as London's Union Chapel.
