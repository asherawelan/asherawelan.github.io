T﻿HIS WEEKEND!
Saturday 18th February: The Breath
Doors 7.30pm
Start 8.00pm
In just a few days we’ll be welcoming you to The Breath (supported by Tapestri), live in Conwy. Demand has been really high for this event, and every ticket has been sold. With that in mind, please don’t arrive with additional members in your party who don’t have a ticket.
On the night, you will need your ticket printed or on your app.
The venue is on Rose Hill Street in Conwy, and the Vicarage Pay & Display Carpark is opposite - there are plenty of places to park.
You can find the venue here on google maps.
Doors and bar open at 7.30 pm, come early, nab the best seats and get a bottle of ale or glass of wine. Soft drinks and hot chocolate will also be served.
Once again we are working with one of our local breweries. For that reason, can I please ask you kindly not to bring your own alcohol, and to support the fairly priced bar. Payment by card is preferred.
Looking forward to seeing you there - travel safe!

I﻿n 2021, we hosted a space for Kirk McElhinney and Michele Stodart. It was such a memorable evening. This year's event promises to be something just as wonderful. Same vibe, at the same venue - something to warm those winter blues. Book early to avoid disappointment.

N﻿EWS: The Breath will be supported on the night by Tapestri. Sarah Zyborska (SERA) and Lowri Evans will be especially familiar to Welsh music audiences as bilingual singer-songwriters that have been performing as solo artists for some time.

The Breath is Manchester-based guitarist Stuart McCallum and singer/flautist Ríoghnach Connolly. They met on the city’s gig circuit in the late noughties. An unlikely pairing though it was, he an acclaimed guitar whiz, ex long-time member of The Cinematic Orchestra and a softly spoken Manchester urbanite, she a folk singer with a larger-than-life personality and a powerful voice to match. Their connection was immediate; they formed The Breath in 2016, a singer-songwriter duo to present their contemporary take on alt-folk.
For them, it’s all about the song. Connolly is a storyteller and their exquisitely crafted, honest, personal, heartfelt songs are as likely to touch on childhood summers and first love as cultural dislocation, post-colonial injustices and grief. But it’s Ríoghnach’s impassioned delivery and extraordinary stop-you-in-your-tracks voice, coupled with Stuart’s understated brilliance that is so engaging.
The Breath has released three albums on Peter Gabriel’s Real World label. Their breakthrough album, ‘Carry Your Kin’ (2016) delved deeply into the spaces between rock, ambient and Irish folk, where layered vocals, mesmerising guitar riffs and expansive folk arrangements created a big sound. ‘Let the Cards Fall’ followed in 2018, and, like the first, was recorded with a full band granting a multi-textured kaleidoscope of sound with a cinematic sensibility. References to Celtic history and cultural loss are woven into a bewitching collection of songs that span beguiling ballads and punch-the-air anthems. In support of the release, Stuart and Ríoghnach performed a series of shows – just the two of them. Stripped bare, they found a new depth and beauty in their songs allowing their extraordinary connection to shine through. The duo returned to the studio in 2019 to record ‘Only Stories (Let the Cards Fall Revisited)’ reimagining previous work (alongside two new songs) taking it back to its acoustic roots. This new direction would see Ríoghnach Connolly receive an RTÉ Folk Award nomination for Best Folk Singer and win Folk Singer Of The Year at the 2019 BBC R2 Folk Awards for which the duo were also nominated as Best Duo/Group.
During the pandemic of 2020/2021, The Breath returned to the studio to record a set of songs in remembrance of American lost folk icon, Karen Dalton. In the spring of 2021, they released a two-track single, ‘Something On Your Mind’ and the original song, ‘Remembering Mountains’. They release their third studio album on Real World Records in 2023.
